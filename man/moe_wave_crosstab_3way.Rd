  x,
  y,
  z,
  df,
  weight,
  remove = c(""),
  n = TRUE,
  pct_type = "row",
  format = "long",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The independent variable}

\item{y}{The dependent variable}

\item{z}{The second control variable, uniquely identifies survey waves}

\item{df}{The data source}

\item{weight}{The weighting variable}

\item{remove}{An optional character vector of values to remove from final table (e.g. "refused").
This will not affect any calculations made. The vector is not case-sensitive.}

\item{n}{logical, if TRUE numeric totals are included.}

\item{pct_type}{Controls the kind of percentage values returned. One of "row" or "cell."}

\item{format}{one of "long" or "wide"}
}
\value{
a tibble
}
\description{
\code{moe_wave_crosstab_3way} returns a tibble containing a weighted crosstab of two variables by a third variable with margin of error.
Use this function when the z-variable indicates different survey
waves for which weights were calculated independently.
}
\details{
Options  include row or cell percentages. The tibble can be in long or wide format.
 These tables are ideal for use with small multiples created with ggplot2::facet_wrap.
